Tamagotchi/Pokemon personalized (don't sue me Nintendo)

A fun (hopefully short) project to create a desktop widget that will allow you to take care of a little pet. Mostly a project for fun to improve my programming and artistic skills. 

# Build command at the moment
gcc -o tamagamon main.c -I/usr/include/SDL2 -D_REENTRANT -lSDL2
